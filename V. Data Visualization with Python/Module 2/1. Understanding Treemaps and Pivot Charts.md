# Understanding Treemaps and Pivot Charts

## Treemaps

Treemaps are a form of data visualization that displays hierarchical data using nested rectangles. Each branch of the hierarchy is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. Treemaps are particularly useful for visualizing large datasets where the hierarchical structure is crucial, offering an intuitive and space-efficient way to display data.

### Applications of Treemaps

Treemaps are employed across various domains due to their ability to effectively communicate complex hierarchical data. Some common applications include:

1. **Business Analytics**: Visualizing the composition of sales by product categories and subcategories.
2. **Finance**: Displaying the performance of stock portfolios, sectors, and industries.
3. **IT and Network Management**: Representing file systems or network usage, showing the distribution of files and folders.
4. **Bioinformatics**: Displaying hierarchical biological data, such as taxonomies or genomic structures.
5. **Website Analytics**: Showing the structure of website traffic, with rectangles representing web pages and their size indicating the volume of visits.

### Importance in Data Visualization

Treemaps are important in data visualization for several reasons:

- **Space Efficiency**: Treemaps make efficient use of space, allowing large datasets to be visualized within a limited area.
- **Hierarchy Representation**: They provide a clear representation of hierarchical data, showing both the structure and the quantitative relationship between elements.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Treemaps make it easy to compare the sizes of different elements at various levels of the hierarchy.
- **Immediate Insight**: The color and size of the rectangles can quickly convey important information, making it easier for users to spot patterns and outliers.

#### Syntax for Generating Treemap

We can generate Treemaps using the Plotly library in Python.

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install plotly pandas
   ```

2. **Import Libraries**:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import plotly.express as px
   ```

3. **Load Data**:

   ```python
   # Replace with your actual dataset or data source
   data = {
       "Category": ["Category 1", "Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 2", "Category 3"],
       "Subcategory": ["Subcategory 1A", "Subcategory 1B", "Subcategory 2A", "Subcategory 2B", "Subcategory 3A"],
       "Value": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
   }
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   ```

4. **Create Treemap**:

   ```python
   fig = px.treemap(df,
                    path=["Category", "Subcategory"],  # Define hierarchical structure
                    values="Value",  # Size of each rectangle
                    title="Treemap Example")  # Title of the treemap
   ```

5. **Show Treemap**:

   ```python
   fig.show()
   ```

                    "Chairs", "Tables", "Sofas", 
                    "Men", "Women", "Kids"],
    "Sales": [120000, 80000, 30000, 
              50000, 40000, 20000, 
              70000, 90000, 40000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Creating the treemap
fig = px.treemap(
    df,
    path=["Category", 'Subcategory'],
    values="Sales",
    title="Sales Data Treemap"
)
fig.show()
```

   | 3      | Q1   | Desktops    | Accessories     | 3527  |
   | 4      | Q1   | Laptops     | Software Suites | 1182  |
   | …      | …    | …           | …               | …     |
   | 2395   | Q4   | Desktops    | Accessories     | 2557  |
   | 2396   | Q4   | Software    | Accessories     | 2626  |
   | 2397   | Q4   | Desktops    | Components      | 2427  |
   | 2398   | Q4   | Software    | Components      | 1768  |
   | 2399   | Q4   | Peripherals | Components      | 1714  |

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Define the parameters
   num_quarters = 4
   num_categories = 4
   num_subcategories = 3
   num_samples = num_quarters * num_categories * num_subcategories * 50
   
   # Generate sample sales data
   np.random.seed(40)
   
   # Creating sample data
   dates = np.repeat(["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"], 50 * num_categories * num_subcategories)
   categories = np.tile(np.random.choice(["Laptops", "Desktops", "Peripherals", "Software"], size=num_quarters * 50), num_categories * num_subcategories)
   subcategories = np.tile(np.random.choice(["Accessories", "Components", "Software Suites"], size=num_quarters * 50), num_categories * num_subcategories)
   sales_values = np.random.randint(1000, 5000, size=num_samples)
   
   # Create DataFrame
   df = pd.DataFrame({
       "Date": dates,
       "Category": categories,
       "Subcategory": subcategories,
       "Sales": sales_values
   })
   ```

   

2. **Create a Pivot Table**:

   ```python
   # Create pivot table
   pivot_table = df.pivot_table(index="Date", columns=["Category", "Subcategory"], values="Sales", aggfunc=np.sum)
   ```

3. **Generate Pivot Chart**:

   ```python
   # Plotting a pivot chart
   pivot_table.plot(kind="bar", figsize=(14, 8))
   plt.title("Sales Summary of IT Products by Category and Subcategory")
   plt.xlabel("Quarters")
   plt.ylabel("Total Sales")
   plt.grid(False)
   plt.legend(title=("Category", "Subcategory"), bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc="upper left")
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```
