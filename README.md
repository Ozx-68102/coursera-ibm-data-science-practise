### Details for this repo

üìö **Courses Covered**
1. Python for Data Science, AI & Development (‚úÖ**Accomplished**)
2. Python Project for Data Science (‚úÖ**Accomplished**)
3. Databases and SQL for Data Science (‚ñ∂Ô∏è**In progress**)
   - _**Special Note:** This course's structure is divided into two distinct parts. For the first three modules (M1-M3), which focus purely on SQL syntax, I have provided only the corresponding SQL statements. However, for Modules 4 and beyond, which integrate database access with Python programming, I have chosen to create a local database and replicate the learning objectives. This approach ensures that all code remains fully runnable while strictly adhering to the Coursera Honor Code, as it avoids the replication of the course's proprietary environment and data._
