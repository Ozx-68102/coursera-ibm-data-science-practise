### Details for this repo

📚 **Courses Covered**
1. Python for Data Science, AI & Development (✅**Accomplished**)
2. Python Project for Data Science (✅**Accomplished**)
3. Databases and SQL for Data Science (✅**Accomplished**)
   - _**Special Note:** The initial modules (M1-M3) of this course focus purely on SQL syntax and use a proprietary cloud environment. To comply with the Coursera Honor Code and to avoid replicating the course's exclusive data, those parts only contain the corresponding SQL statements in Markdown format._
4. Data Analysis with Python (✅**Accomplished**)
5. Data Visualization with Python (✅**Accomplished**)
   - _**Special Note:** Some of the original lab files contained large visual outputs, making them difficult to display on GitHub. I cleared these outputs to ensure the repository remains lightweight and the files are easily viewable. This practice aligns with best practices for managing Jupyter Notebooks in version control._
6. Machine Learning with Python (▶️**In progress**)
   - _**Special Note:** This course starts directly from Module 2. Module 1 consists entirely of theoretical content without any Labs, thus no practical files were provided for this section._
7. Applied Data Science Capstone (Not started)

🔧 **Tech Stack**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.)
- SQL, Jupyter, GitHub
- Machine Learning, Data Visualization

⚠️ **Important Notes**
- Personal learning records — not for assignment submission.
- Follows Coursera's Honor Code.
- No proprietary course data included.
- **The original notebook has been refactored for clarity and is optimized for the latest PyCharm-integrated Jupyter environment. All deprecated commands and redundant setups have been removed.**
